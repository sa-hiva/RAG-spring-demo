# RAG-spring-demo
RAG chatbot example with Spring AI, PGVector and PDF ingestion.

This is a very simple project to test and learn RAG implementation with Spring AI. I'm feeding the model with my own Master's final project on education (STEAM model applied to the Math class), so the example answers questions on that, but you could change that to any PDF on the matter of your choice =). I'm using PGVector on docker as DB.
